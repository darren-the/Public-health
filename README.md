# Life Expectancy - Regression Analysis
Having recently completed a machine learning course at school, I wanted to apply some of the techniques I learnt to my own project. The topic of public health and diseases have always interested me, so I decided to put my skills to the test using [life expectancy data](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) from kaggle.

## The Goals:
* Predict life expectancy of countries based off various factors such as GDP, schooling, infection rates etc
* Compare the accuracy of different models using metrics like R2 scores

# Understanding the data
Before attempting to build any models, lets first explore some of the data to get a grasp of the variables we are dealing with. Looking through the table below, we can get a good idea of how the data is structured.
